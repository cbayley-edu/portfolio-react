# React Portfolio
### Unit 20 Homework: Update Professional Materials

## Description
For this assignment I rebuilt my Portfolio using React. We were allowed to use existing templates if we found one that we liked - and I did! I made some modifications which I couldn't have done if I didn't have a solid understanding of React. If you know me, then you know that the theme I chose really matches my personality! :)

On my Porfolio you can...  
  * Read my bio, view some applications I've written, and see the "code" behind the websites through my GitHub repo. 
  * Access my social media links (LinkedIn and Twitter), read my SaaSsySAP'er blog, and check out my awesome employer's page.
  * Download my resume, email me, and call me.
